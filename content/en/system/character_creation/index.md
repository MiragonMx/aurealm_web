This is, of course, where it is most important to give your character a name, an age and a history. Try to think about your character's goals in life, what has influenced them, what values they hold dear, and whether they have any tics or behavioural patterns. Take some time to think about this and consider which character you want to play and live.
Now it's time to assign values. The example character presented here will be called Verlon, who at 21 is still quite young. Verlon is not the brightest, but he is physically very well endowed. His Charisma and Dexterity are slightly below average. This results in the following stats:

* **Strength:** 7
* **Dexterity:** 4
* **Constitution:** 8
* **Intelligence:** 2
* **Charisma:** 4


Verlon does not want to learn magic, so he does not spend any APs on this skill, but he can make up for it later, each time he levels up. This gives him the following stats:

| Wert <img width=300/> | Formel <img width=300/> | Verlons Wert <img width=300/> |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hit Points | $(\frac{Strength}{2} + \frac{Constitution}{4}) \cdot level + 10$ | $(\frac{7}{2} + \frac{4}{4}) \cdot 1 + 10 = 15.5$ |
| HP-Regeneration / h | $(\frac{max.~~~HP}{10}) - X (Type~~~of~~~injury)$ | $(\frac{15.5}{10} + \frac{4}{4}) - 0 = 1.6 (rounded)$ |
| Mana Points | $(\frac{Intelligence \cdot level}{2}) + Magic~~~capabilityt \cdot 10$ | $(\frac{2 \cdot 1}{2}) + 0 \cdot 10 = 1$ |
| MP-Regeneration / h | $(\frac{max.~~~Mana}{10})$ | $(\frac{1}{10}) = 0.1 $ |
| Mental Resilience | $(\frac{Charisma \cdot level}{2}) + 50 $ | $(\frac{4 \cdot 1}{2}) + 50 = 52$ |
| MR-Regeneration / h | $(\frac{max.~~~MR}{10}) - X (Type~~~of~~~disturbance)$ | $(\frac{52}{10}) = 5.2 $ |
| Initiative | $(\frac{Strength + 20}{Dexterity})$ | $(\frac{7 + 20}{4}) = 6.8 (rounded) $ |
| Range | $(\frac{Constitution + Dexterity}{2})$ | $(\frac{8 + 4}{2}) = 6 $ |
| Dodge | $(\frac{Dexterity}{2})$ | $(\frac{4}{2}) = 2 $ |

Verlon has already calculated many important values. Now he wants to distribute his initial 150 ability points. He decides to level up *One-Handed 14* (29 AP), *Fist Fighting 5* (6 AP) and *Hunting 9* (14 AP) in the *Handling* talent. He has therefore awarded a total of 49 AP in the skill. To calculate the talent value of *Action*, he must now calculate $\(Talent value = \frac{\sum ability points}{10} \le 8\)$ must be calculated. In Verlon's case, this would be: $\(Talent value = \frac{49}{10} = 4.9 \leq 8\)$. His talent value for *Action* is now rounded up to 5. He can now always roll on this value if he wants to perform an action of the *Action* talent but has not learnt the correct ability. In addition, all his abilities in the *Action* skill are improved by his **Dexterity** attribute. To do this, the attribute value (Verlon has **Constitution 8**) must be divided by four ($+ \frac{4}{8} = +2$). This improves all *Action* abilities by +2, which is why he now has *one-handed 16*, *fistfighting 7* and *hunting 11*.

Verlon learns the following abilities in *Social*: *Flirt 10* (17 AP), *Inspire 6* (8 AP), *Humour 12* (23 AP) and *Convince 8* (12 AP). This gives him a total of 60 AP in *Social*, giving him an talent score of 6. Because he has a **Charisma** attribute score of 4, Verlon also gets a +1 to all his *Social* abilities.

Verlon now has 41 APs left to spend in the *Knowledge* talent. He decides to invest 26 AP in religion (*Religion 11*). He also levels up *Woodworking 8* (12 AP) and *Medicine 3* (3 AP). This results in an talent value of 4.1, i.e. 4. The **Intelligence** attribute of 2 results in an talent improvement of 0.5, which is rounded to 1 and gives him +1 to all *Knowledge* abilities.

In addition, Verlon can now add the five standard abilitiers and is finished with his character creation.
