This is an example post for the set of rules. Formulas can be included here like this, for example:

$$SP~=~\frac{\mathrm{Dexterity}}{2}.$$

Inline formulas with `\(` and `\)` are also possible: \( x = 7 + 4 \).

For 'displaystyle' formulas, delimiters with `\[` or `\]` can be used in addition to the `$$` delimiters used above:

$$
HP = \frac{L \cdot 2}{10}+10 \qquad (or something similar..),
$$

where $L$ stands for the level of a character.
