Welcome to the world of Arkanthia!

We are a group of enthusiastic nerds playing our first real pen and paper campaign. We have developed our own homebrew system called Arkanthia and created a website for it (many thanks to Moritz!). The entire Arkanthia rulebook will soon be available here for free.

In addition, we will upload a pen and paper blog every two weeks in time for the weekend, in which we play a campaign in the world of Arkanthia ourselves. After an exciting escape from a slave mine, the four heroes <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theobald Bonter</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric von Praven</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel Tuh Las</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> finally experience freedom again. But instead of leading a quiet life, the four quickly stumble into the nearest bar and shortly afterwards into an exciting adventure in which they have to deal with secret guilds, government persecution and their pathetically poor social skills.

In addition to the Arkanthia rulebook and the pen and paper blog, we also plan to upload a pen and paper guide for beginners. We also have big plans to add more features for our own campaign, such as maps, character pages and pictures. However, it is not yet clear exactly when we will be able to do this.
