We are a group consisting of five enthusiastic nerds playing our first real pen & paper campaign.

Our Game Master (GM), despite having only marginal experience in this field, directly had the desire to create a completely own homebrew system including a full world and I, in turn, had the motivation to design and manage our own website for this purpose.

That's already the whole background for this site.
We have big plans for the further expansion, the exact time implementation of which is not so easy to foresee.
