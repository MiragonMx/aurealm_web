Welcome to the world of Arkanthia,

we are a group of five enthusiastic nerds playing our first real pen & paper campaign.

Our Dungeon Master (DM) immediately had the desire to create a complete homebrew system including a full world and I in turn had the motivation to design and manage a website for it. That's the whole background for this site.

In addition to a weekly uploaded blog, the rulebook will also be made available free of charge in the future, as well as an introduction to the campaign being played. We also have big plans to add more features for our campaign, such as maps, character pages and pictures. However, the exact timing of their realisation is not yet foreseeable.
