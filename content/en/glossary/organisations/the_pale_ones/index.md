The Pale Ones are a band of bandits who set out on a ship from the island of Ceandryssnar in the north to raid Zazyrus. They almost completely destroyed the village of Bingst, for example, and Selbingen also suffered badly from their raids. They got their name because a potion gave them a transparent appearance to frighten the inhabitants of the raided villages.
