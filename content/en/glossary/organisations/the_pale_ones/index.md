The Pale Ones are a band of bandits who set out on a ship from the island of Ceandryssnar in the north to raid <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/zazyrus">}} >Zazyrus</a>. They almost completely destroyed the village of Bingst, for example, and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a> also suffered badly from their raids. They got their name because a potion gave them a transparent appearance to frighten the inhabitants of the raided villages.
