The <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/ullana_nana">}} >Ullana Nana</a> Islands are six islands of volcanic origin located in the Luvua Delta. Their capital is the harbor town of Wanga on the second largest island of the group. The largest island is currently uninhabited, as an active volcano frequently rages here.
