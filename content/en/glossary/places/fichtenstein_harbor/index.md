Summary: “A small harbor that belongs to Fichtenstein.”
---
The port of Fichtenstein is the only port in the north of Zazyrus and therefore quite important for transshipment to and from Rhatcyl. But other ships also land here. Mostly sailors live here in temporary barracks, the rest of the harbor is dominated by warehouses and wharves.
