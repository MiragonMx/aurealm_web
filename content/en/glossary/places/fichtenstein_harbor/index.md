Summary: “A small harbor that belongs to Fichtenstein.”
---
The port of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a> is the only port in the north of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/zazyrus">}} >Zazyrus</a> and therefore quite important for transshipment to and from <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/rhatcyl">}} >Rhatcyl</a>. But other ships also land here. Mostly sailors live here in temporary barracks, the rest of the harbor is dominated by warehouses and wharves.
