Thauros is a small kingdom that is considered a protectorate of Zazyrus. Relations are so close that members of the royal family of Zazyrus first ascend the throne of Thauros to gain experience in royal affairs. Only later, after the death of the current Zyren, do they take over the rule of Zazyrus.
