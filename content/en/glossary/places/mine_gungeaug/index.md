It is located in the North Marsh and belongs to <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/monsieur_chiraque">}} >Monsieur Chiraque</a>. As the mine is important for <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/zazyrus">}} >Zazyrus</a>' goals, it is granted special permits. These include tax relief and the legalization of slave labour.
