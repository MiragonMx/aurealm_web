---

The 'Gungeaug' mine produces large quantities of Nztrv rock every day, which is picked up by train twice a week. It is located in the North Marsh and belongs to Monsieur Chiraque. As the mine is important for Zazyrus' goals, it is granted special permits. These include tax relief and the legalization of slave labour.
