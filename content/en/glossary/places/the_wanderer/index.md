“The Wanderer” is a cozy inn made of rustic cut stones. It is located halfway between Fichtenstein and Selbingen on the Helenau trade route. The owner Elisabeth takes excellent care of her guests. One of the inn's special features is its own brewery, which Elisabeth is happy to give a short guided tour of.
