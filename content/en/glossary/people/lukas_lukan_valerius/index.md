Summary: “Lukas Lukan Valerius is the owner of the trading post in Selbingen.”
---
A rather small, very open-minded man, who actually radiates an exuberant joy. As the owner of the <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a> trading post, this often helps him to sell a lot and make his customers happy. However, for some reason he is very unpopular with our four heroes.
