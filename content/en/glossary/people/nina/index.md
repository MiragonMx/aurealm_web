Summary: “Nina is a prostitute our heroes met by chance on the way to Feth.”
---
Our four heroes came across the prostitute <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/nina">}} >Nina</a> by chance on their journey to <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/feth">}} >Feth</a>. But they used this coincidence perfectly to install <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/nina">}} >Nina</a> as a replacement for <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/emanuel">}} >Emanuel</a> in the <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/monsieur_chiraque">}} >Chiraque</a> residence. After all, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/nina">}} >Nina</a> probably has very good access to the most important people there and can therefore serve as a good source of information.
