Summary: “Nina is a prostitute our heroes met by chance on the way to Feth.”
---
Our four heroes came across the prostitute Nina by chance on their journey to Feth. But they used this coincidence perfectly to install Nina as a replacement for Emanuel in the Chiraque residence. After all, Nina probably has very good access to the most important people there and can therefore serve as a good source of information.
