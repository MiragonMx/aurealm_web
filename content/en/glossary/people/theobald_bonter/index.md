Summary: “Theobald Bonter, or actually just Theo, is a halfling and the smallest of our four adventurers. He uses his size to the advantage of his group in various situations, be it in battle, where he surprises his opponents from ambush, or to secretly obtain information that is really none of his business.”

I'm Theobald Bonter, but everyone actually calls me Theo. I got my surname from my humble farming parents, Bill and Bo, where I grew up on the farm in the Bingst estates with my brother.

There I quickly left my family behind as I grew, because at 98 cm I am already one of the taller halflings. When I grew up a few years ago, I left this home behind me in other ways too, because I realized that there was more to my life than cabbages and haylofts. Since then, I've managed to get by, using my physical abilities to my advantage here and there and honing my skills in the flexible acquisition of objects of interest and information.

Of course, I also do the latter regularly with my means of defense of choice: my daggers. I've learned to use them in tricky situations, especially out of surprise, and otherwise try to stay out of conflicts - literally, relying (more or less justifiably) on my throwing skills with daggers, stars or slingshots. Naturally, I'm not quite as good at stabbing, but after a rather unpleasant period of absolute bondage in the Nztrv mine “Gungeaug”, I've now found my group of fiends.

They can handle it better and individual “cough” Kel Tuh Las “cough” also know how to emphasize their strength, so despite sporadic absurd outbreaks of violence, I really enjoy traveling with them and have already seen and achieved a lot in this time together - in the meantime it has even taken us past my family, whether that was really a good thing I still have to think about for myself...But I'm sure there's still a lot to come and I definitely wouldn't swap it for the cabbages!
