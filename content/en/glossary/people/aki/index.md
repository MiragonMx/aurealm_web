<a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aki">}} >Aki</a> is a small woodcutter who lives in the forest around the mead factory "Odin's Waters". He often has arguments with his brother Odin and therefore lives a secluded life in the forest. He also keeps completely out of the affairs of the manufactory.
