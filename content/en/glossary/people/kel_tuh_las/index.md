Summary: "Kel Tuh Las is one of our four heroes on this adventure. With strong magical abilities, pumped-up muscles and a sharp mind, he can strike fear into the hearts of many enemies. However, his tendency to do rash things and flirt with everything that's not three on the tree often terrifies his friends."

My name is <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel Tuh Las</a>,

I am 25, 195 cm tall, my chest circumference is also 195 cm and I bench press more than anyone else, so this adventure belongs to me and I am the sole ruler here.

In addition to my extremely charming demeanor, which every woman immediately falls for almost "magically", I am also extremely adept at using so-called "word jokes". Differences of opinion are often won in my favor by my mere presence.

I have grown very fond of my loyal companions, who have stood by my side in several battles and tricky situations and whom I can always rely on blindly: my best friend "Pongo", the shimmering blue dog; the one with the thickest antlers in the whole forest - my shimmering blue moose, "Fat Eumel" and my shimmering blue, totally non-magical battle axe Diplomacy, which is necessary for aggressive negotiations.

Naturally, I am well trained in handling two-handed tools that are as thick as a branch, but I also have a delicate touch for one-handed matters.

I am also highly educated. My outstanding intellect is underlined by my specialization in the knowledge of foreign peoples and the presentation of particularly sophisticated scripts.
