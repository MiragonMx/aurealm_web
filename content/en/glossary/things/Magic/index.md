Magic is a strange form of energy that only a select few can use, as magic perceives them as hosts. With the help of spells, magic can be used to implement the will of the chosen one. To do this, the magic leaves the magician's body and forms their spell. Magically conjured objects always have a transparent character and are surrounded by a blue shimmer. After the spell has been cast, the magic is released from its predetermined form and disperses into its surroundings. As a result, there is a lot of scattered magic throughout the world. Over time, the mage's magic reserve, also known as mana, is passively replenished as the scattered magic voluntarily gathers back into a host.
The reaction of magic that encounters Nztrv is special. Both react violently with each other and form a new, glass-like substance at the point of contact.
