Summary: “A beige, golden stone with special properties.”
---
Moonstones are very rare stones that are extremely valuable not only because of their rarity, but also because of their unique properties. They are an excellent forging material as they combine lightness and extreme stability. In addition, a sharp blade stays sharp forever and never needs to be resharpened. But moonstones also look great on the surface. A light beige color is interspersed with golden yellow fibers. It looks as if the material is moving like a liquid.
