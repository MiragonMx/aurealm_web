summary: "The last blog ended at the Fichtenstein cemetery with our four heroes interrogating the grave robber Karl Flittenberg. However, as he wasn't very willing to talk, they have to come up with something for today to tease a bit of information out of Karl. Find out how that goes and why it leads them to the harbour of Fichtenstein here:"

After a little shopping at <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/hellebard_dunkel">}} >Hellebard Dunkel</a> last time, our four adventurers accepted the quest from Herzfried Oben, the priest of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a>. They were to guard the graveyard to find and arrest a grave robber. This worked quite well and they were able to arrest their quest target, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/karl_flittenberg">}} >Karl Flittenberg</a>, on the very first night. However, the subsequent interrogation has so far been rather unsuccessful, which is why our four now want to shift up a gear.

<a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel Tuh Las</a>' fist flies unrestrainedly into <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/karl_flittenberg">}} >Karl</a>'s face and, annoyed, he repeats the question about the target of the grave desecration. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/karl_flittenberg">}} >Karl</a> seems surprised and a little intimidated that the trial is now being continued with violence. But at first he only mumbles something about a ‘paid job’. But when <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> cracks his knuckles again and strikes the next blow, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/karl_flittenberg">}} >Karl</a> comes to his senses and decides not to let himself be knocked unconscious. Slowly, he begins to talk about a client in the harbour of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a>. He is probably looking for the amulet of the Dornenfells, a family that was once very present in <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a>. But now they have disappeared and only a few family members are still rotting in <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a>'s cemetery.

This information makes <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a>'s fist drop for the time being and he enquires in more detail about the mysterious commissioner. 
But here again, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/karl_flittenberg">}} >Karl</a>'s information is rather vague and he merely explains that he was supposed to hide the amulet in a cave near the harbour and that he would find a reward there later. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> is actually satisfied with this, but <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> wonders a little how <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/karl_flittenberg">}} >Karl</a> got his mission if he doesn't even know his client. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> looks confused for a moment, but then nods in agreement, not really understanding <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a>'s question. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/karl_flittenberg">}} >Karl</a>, on the other hand, does and realises that he can trick <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> but not <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a>. However, as he still has a lot of respect for the next clamp, he explains that he received the order from a certain lieutenant who would be monitoring events in the harbour. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> is now satisfied with this. 

The question now is what to do with their prisoner. But contrary to their nature, this time they don't cut up the soles of his feet. Instead, they untie <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/karl_flittenberg">}} >Karl</a> and make it very clear to him that they never want to see him again and that he should get the hell out of the region. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/karl_flittenberg">}} >Karl</a> nods anxiously and runs straight back to the wooden palisade with everything he has and swings out of their field of vision. The next quest destination is now clear for our four, but first they want to get a good night's sleep. But they prefer <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/udo">}} >Udo</a>'s beds to the church pews.

The next morning starts late and could actually be called lunchtime. After a little refreshment, our heroes set off in the direction of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a> harbour. As they leave <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a>, they pass the second village gate and are greeted by <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kevin">}} >Kevin</a>. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/simon">}} >Simon</a> spoke to <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kevin">}} >Kevin</a> about the group at the last changing of the guard and is now looking forward to getting to know them.  After a brief chat, they really do make their way to the harbour.

About 45 minutes later, they arrive at a cosy harbour. A few warehouses and a large loading terminal characterise the small collection of houses. Three ship masts can also be seen above the roofs of the houses. But that is of course of secondary importance to our friends. They are almost magically attracted to the local bar. ‘The Boozing Mermaid’ is a rather shabby pub, but at least it has a maritime ambience and, above all, beer. As soon as they enter, they realise that the average level here would be life-threatening for most people and they immediately feel at home. The barman greets them at the bar and introduces himself as Norbert. But our heroes don't care and decide to call him <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/odu">}} >Odu</a> in future. As they also order some beer in the same breath, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/odu">}} >Odu</a> accepts his new name and sets about tapping the beers.

On his return, he is immediately bombarded with a barrage of questions and explains that there is nothing exciting happening in the harbour at the moment, that there are three ships in the harbour and that a ship from Ulana Nana recently disappeared off the coast. Of course, they could also stay overnight or eat at his place, depending on what they fancy. At the moment, they are primarily in the mood for drinking, which is why they throw themselves into the bar life of the ‘<a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/the_boozing_mermaid">}} >boozing mermaid</a>’. But you won't find out how this turns out for another two weeks in Arkanthia Pen and Paper.
