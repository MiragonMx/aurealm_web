summary: "Our four friends, Kel Tuh Las, Theo, Aldric and LÃ¶wenzahn, arrive in the small village of Fichtenstein in this session. Instead of looking around for a possible main quest, they prefer to plan a party with their new best friend, the barkeeper Udo. While organizing the party, they also get to know the villager Ulrich a little better. You can find out more about him and his wife Helena here:"
