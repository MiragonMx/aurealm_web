summary: "In the last blog, Aldric set off on a little adventure on his own. He explored the oyster farm near Fichtenstein harbour and got to know its owner, Zetti. Today we find out what our other three friends have been up to in the meantime. You can find out why it all ended in a break-in here:"

After our four friends got to know each other in the next bar in the last session, Aldric embarked on a small side quest in which they were to collect potion ingredients for the herbalist Rosvita. To do this, he went to the small oyster farm near the Fichtenstein harbour. Instead of looking for the owner there, he decided to help himself to the freely available oysters. Aldric was very happy with this, but Zetti, the owner of the farm, was anything but. And so, at the end of the last blog, Aldric had to take to his heels before he was out of range of Zetti's bow.

While Aldric was taking care of the oysters last time, Löwenzahn, Theo, and Kel Tuh Las were meanwhile wandering around the harbor of Fichtenstein. They realized that, although it was already their second day there, they hadn't actually been near the water yet. So, they decided to change that and headed to the pier of the small town, which seemed quite calm, almost deserted. 

There were three ships docked: the "Arsena's Tail" and the "Selania" from Ullana Nana, and the "Damp Grotto" from Rhatcyl. Our three adventurers aren't exactly international, so they didn't find the ships or their crews particularly interesting. However, a sailor from Ullana Nana was very interested in them and approached them directly. He introduced himself as Eduardo and explained that his friend José had been missing for some time. Their ship was about to depart, and he needed help finding José. Our friends had heard something similar in the harbor tavern before, so they noted this obvious side quest in their imaginary notebooks but quickly returned to their main objective: the loading terminal. 

The terminal was the busiest place, with sailors occasionally coming out or going inside. They quickly found the stairs leading to the first floor of the terminal, where the office of the mysterious lieutenant was located. However, they didn't want to proceed without Aldric, and Theo had an excellent idea. He wanted to break into the office at night to get an initial look and possibly gather something to use against the lieutenant. So, they left the terminal and stepped back onto the small pier, where they were met by Aldric, who was jogging towards them in wet pants.

After our four friends shared all their experiences, they had a few hours to kill before nightfall, and where better to do that than in a rundown harbor tavern? After consuming a few hectoliters of beer, it was time for Theo to begin his breaking and entering mission. Löwenzahn, Kel Tuh Las, and Aldric joined him to keep watch, so around 11 PM, the four left the "Drunken Mermaid" and stepped into the pitch-dark night. They quickly reached the warehouses and eventually the loading terminal. Although it was locked, this proved to be no problem for Theo, who made it look easy.

Inside, the terminal hadn't changed much since their last visit. Theo cautiously sneaked up the stairs to the first floor, while the other three took their positions to keep watch. If anyone unwelcome appeared, they were to alert Theo with their agreed-upon warning cry: "Toucan, Toucan."

The upper floor was smaller than the storage area below, so it didn't take Theo long to find the office. There were only a few desks for employees and some crates overflowing with paper. Theo carefully approached the door, which bore a modest, definitely not flashy, solid gold plaque with the name "Kampf." With deft movements, he quickly picked the lock and entered a large, glass-walled office. The restraint shown at the door decoration continued inside. A massive polished spruce desk (at least he buys locally), an almost royally imposing desk chair, and a red checkered carpet adorned the office. However, Theo was more interested in incriminating documents than interior decoration, so he let the ostentatious furniture be and started searching through drawers. Apart from various letters, invoices, and delivery notes, there wasn't much to be found. The only oddity was a drawer containing a rope and a bottle with a clear liquid. Whether Lieutenant Kampf simply liked drinking vodka while playing rodeo, or if it was something more mysterious, you’ll find out in two weeks on Arkanthia Pen and Paper.
