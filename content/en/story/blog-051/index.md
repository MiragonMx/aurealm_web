summary: "The sulphur ponds lie behind our heroes, but the hardest steps are yet to come – the journey back to Feth. What they have discovered about Grete will change the village, but it will also give the residents the chance for a new beginning. Find out here whether our friends will be part of it."
---

Our friends spent several sessions trying to solve the mystery of Grete. Last time, they even got to meet Grete herself – albeit only in her ghostly form. Now that they are certain that neither Grete nor her ghost will ever cause any more harm, they finally set off on their way back to Feth.

Tired, our heroes crawl out of their sleeping bags in the morning. Fortunately, their small camp on the edge of the sulphur ponds was not disturbed by bandits or wild animals. The last few days have taken their toll, and they are glad to finally be on their way to Feth.

After less than an hour, they leave the sulphur ponds behind them and reach the small road connecting Feth with the coastal village of Zist. The hike is strenuous, but nothing compared to their chaotic journey through the Kresto Plateau. After a short lunch break in the rolling hills around Zist, they work their way closer to their destination kilometre by kilometre and finally reach Feth shortly before dusk. They are eagerly awaited, but what they have to tell is too much to cover in half an evening. So they announce that they will gather with the entire village in the former Jarl's house the next morning. Afterwards, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> head straight for Gerda's inn, ‘Die müden Pferdebeine’ (The Tired Horse Legs) – today more appropriately named ‘Die müden Menschenbeine’ (The Tired Human Legs). Over beer and a warm meal, they enjoy finally having a real bed again.

The muscle ache they wake up with the next morning is intense. But there is no time to complain. A few minutes later, they are already standing in the Jarl's house. As expected, the entire village is gathered and looking eagerly at the four adventurers. As in <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel Tuh Las</a> takes the floor:

"Dear village community of Feth. Our investigations into Grete's case have confirmed your worst fears. We followed her trail to the sulphur ponds, where we found her hideout. There we found not only a wealth of information about her motives, but also the bodies of the missing villagers. Unfortunately, we were unable to take all the remains with us. However, we have recovered the skulls of your loved ones and would like to bury them with you behind the Jarl's house by your tree of life, so that you finally have a place to mourn."

Silence fills the hall. The shock is written all over everyone's faces.

After a few moments of subdued silence, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> loses his patience. ‘Come on,’ he says loudly, grabbing the sack with the skulls. ‘Here we have the first head.’ He tosses the skull playfully between his hands. ‘Who wants to bury it?’ His friends stare at him in horror – and the village reacts with little enthusiasm. ‘Show some respect,’ hisses Konstanze, the wife of the former jarl. She stands up, steps directly in front of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> and hisses, ‘You'd better wait outside now.’ Shaking his head, he turns towards the door. ‘We have other things to do,’ he says, tossing the skull to Konstanze and strolling out.

‘Maybe we should actually start with the funerals so that we have enough time for each victim,’ <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> tries to save the situation. The mood remains tense, but the residents agree. Together they follow <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> outside – only to see him peeing on the spruce tree that was supposed to serve as a burial site.

‘You can't be serious!’ <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> exclaims, stunned. Konstanze appears behind him, glares at <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> and hisses, ‘Get out of our village!’ <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> raises his hands apologetically. ‘All right, for God's sake. They're already dead anyway.’ Then he marches towards the inn.

Since no one wants to bury their loved ones under a ‘marked’ tree, they walk a little further to an old oak tree. ‘It's nice here. Let's bury the skulls here,’ Konstanze suggests. The group agrees. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> begin to dig, while the women tie small wooden crosses. One by one, they are buried, and each is given a moment of remembrance.

After a little more than half an hour, seven crosses stand around the oak tree. ‘This has become a dignified place. We thank you three. But you should urgently teach the other one some manners,’ says Konstanze. The three heroes nod sheepishly and say goodbye.

Then they make their way back to the inn. But you won't find out what their next destinations are until in two weeks' time at Arkanthia Pen and Paper.
