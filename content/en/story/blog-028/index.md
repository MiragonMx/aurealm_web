summary: "Having just returned from a minor side mission, our four heroes were relaxing with a cold beer at the ‘Zum gekochten Scheinekopf’ inn. But when they open the door of the inn to make their way home, they are met by a thick fog that engulfs the familiar streets. One look is enough and they know: The next attack has begun. Will our friends be able to stop the invisible threat this time and save the town? The answer awaits you here:

With a short trip to an iron mine, our four friends were able to make the blacksmith Meckmo Hämmerich very happy in the last blog. Not only does he now have ore again with which he can do his work, he can also supply his home village with newly forged weapons. And our four friends will probably find out just how necessary these are today. After a relaxing evening in the ‘Boiled Pig's Head’, they were actually just heading home last time, but less than two metres from the door they find themselves in thick fog. Startled, they look at each other and immediately decide to go to their little house, which Mayor Siegfried had given them for temporary use.

They sprint through the still unfamiliar alleyways before finally reaching the market square in Selbingen. After a few metres, they finally reach the house and immediately begin to barricade it from the inside.While Aldric readies himself with his bow on the upper floor and Theo prepares to throw a few throwing stars from an elevated position, Kel and Löwenzahns position themselves next to the front door to secure the house from intruders.Holding their breath, the two stand in the dusty hallway and listen intently into the darkness.Aldric and Theo also remain in a waiting position and stare into the thick fog. Suddenly they hear creaking wood on wet stone from the direction of Lake Selbig and not a second later the sound of iron boots on the stony beach of Selbingen. They know: Their enemies have now arrived.

From their defensive position, they watch as some of the villagers, frightened and carrying only the bare necessities, scurry into the small church on the market square to seek safety.To their discomfort, our four heroes hardly hear anything since the arrival of their opponents.But then Aldric spots a creature coming towards them across the market square.Dressed in leather armour and armed with a sword, it shuffles unerringly towards them.And then Theo and Aldric realise what makes their enemies so sinister: ashen skin, almost transparent in appearance, stretches across the swordsman's bony face.Something ghostly surrounds him and sends a cold shiver down their spines.But it only gets worse, because to make matters worse, four more fighters emerge from the fog one by one behind the first pale man.While three continue to move unerringly towards them and are now less than five metres away, Aldric can see the other two pale ones pull a bow from their backs and fire the first two arrows at them. Aldric is able to dodge this attack with a quick leap to the side and immediately returns fire. Theo also grabs one of his throwing stars and hurls it at their opponents.While Theo hits, but does hardly any damage with his throwing stars, Aldric has had a really bad day today.First, one of the enemy archers dodges, and when he then redirects his fire at the melee fighters, who are now standing directly in front of their house, he encounters the most agile swordsman in <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/Aurealm">}} >Aurealm</a>. In an almost dance-like display, he dodges three of Aldric's arrows at close range before Aldric finally gets his revenge and sinks half his quiver into the swordsman.

But what are Löwenzahn and Kel Tuh Las actually doing in the meantime? While the former is sinking several javelins into his opponents and bitterly defending the entrance to their house, Kel goes on a reconnaissance tour with his magical mouse to find out whether other warriors have entered the town and, if so, where they are. To his horror, he discovers a second group of the Pale Ones just outside Lukas Lucan Valerius' trading account. Furious, he races towards the first one with his mouse and bites a large chunk out of the intruder's leather boot. Startled, the intruder whirls around and freezes when he sees the shimmering blue mouse. Kel chases it towards the next warrior and manages to smash the group of five fighters. 

But before he can pursue them any further, he hears Löwenzahn calling for his help. He returns to his body and realises that Löwenzahn is having problems securing the entrance to her house on her own. So Kel uses his magical powers again and summons his wolf. Löwenzahn jumps to the side while Kel and his wolf rush through the front door. He hits the first fighter on the chest and pulls him to the ground. The remaining Pale Ones catch sight of the magical wolf and freeze at the terrifying sight. They also flee, but are covered in a hail of javelins, arrows and flying daggers. They actually catch one of the pale ones, who stumbles and then lies motionless.

The last arrow has just left the string of Aldric's bow when they hear a loud bang that leaves the world in complete silence for an eternally long second. A huge fireball at the other end of Selbingen lights up the whole village before collapsing again a few moments later. But it leaves behind a huge blaze, which our heroes can still clearly see through the fog from their house. But you won't find out what just blew up until the next Arkanthia Pen and Paper.
