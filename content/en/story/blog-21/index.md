summary: "After Theo, Löwenzahn and Kel Tuh Las decided to drag Aldric to the next island last time, the three of them also explore it today. In the process, Löwenzahn makes an interesting discovery. You can find out what it is here:"
---

A panic attack by Aldric that developed into a permanent phobia of water, the discovery of a very rare stone, a fight with the Ullanic sailor Eduardo and the journey to the previously unknown island of Logar. This all happened in the last Arkanthia Pen and Paper blog. Today we continue our exploration of the island of Logar, with Aldric concentrating on getting his fear of the water under control. To do this, he has made himself comfortable on the beach with a view inland. Löwenzahn, Theo and Kel Tuh Las are not particularly interested in spending time with Aldric, however, preferring instead to explore the island. So they leave most of their things with Aldric and walk along the beach.

After half an hour's walk, however, they realise that the island is not much different from Midgar. But just before they want to turn around, Löwenzahn discovers something pink lying on the beach. A short sprint later, he is standing in front of a large jellyfish, its long nettles splaying out in all directions. Interested, Löwenzahn pokes the jellyfish with his shoe, but as expected, the jellyfish only reacts by wobbling its body and does not suddenly start a conversation with Löwenzahn. Unfortunately, his knowledge of nature doesn't help him either, which is why Löwenzahn sees only one way to find out more about the creature. He puts on his leather gloves, tears off a nettle and slaps it on Theo's arm. Theo looks at Löwenzahn in shock, complains what this is all about and then realises the pain. He hastily removes the nettle from his arm and tries to rinse it off in the sea water, but the train has left the station. His skin burns like fire and, furious, Löwenzahn gets a barrage of swear words. But then Theo suddenly starts to laugh. And then he laughs even louder. And then he runs in circles. He throws his arms up. And then he runs away.

Kel and Löwenzahn look at each other with amusement and wonder why the second member of the group has to go crazy after Aldric. Of course, it doesn't occur to them that the whole thing could have been Löwenzahn's fault. But before Theo disappears completely into the distance, Löwenzahn grabs some of the nettles and then they decide to collect Theo again. Meanwhile, Theo is happy about every stone, every leaf and every beautiful wave. But then he takes an interest in the interior and runs through dense forest before coming across a small lake. This is where Löwenzahn and Kel Tuh Las finally catch up with him. The two try to talk some sense into him and persuade him to return to their boat. But Theo has other plans and leaves again, babbling wildly, to set off on new adventures. And so Kel and Löwenzahn trot after Theo, who has gone mad, for just under an hour. In the process, they explore Logar and realise that Midgar's sister island is a good deal bigger and even has some impressive little mountains. However, it has to be said that the effect of the jellyfish nettle impresses them even more.

After what feels like an eternity, Theo calms down a little and although he is still hyper, it is still a nice change for his two companions not to have to stop at every little tree because Theo wants to marvel at it. With some good coaxing and by drawing Theo's attention purely by chance to things that are back in the direction of Aldric, they slowly but surely move back towards him. 

After another half hour, they are back in front of the still pale Aldric, who is looking at them with real pity. Now that the three of them have got a good enough impression of Logar and are somewhat disillusioned that there are no wild adventures to be had here, they are at least somewhat motivated to paddle back to Fichtenstein. Aldric, on the other hand, cannot share this motivation. He absent-mindedly sits down in the small boat again, but this time not without first making it clear that they really have to go to the harbour of Fichtenstein and not decide on a new excursion destination. This is actually a very good idea, as Kel, Theo and Löwenzahn are also looking forward to Udo's soft beds. 

They finally reach the harbour late in the evening. Exhausted from the journey, they clamber out of the boat. As Eduardo is no longer around, they don't really know how to hand over the dinghy to the crew of the ‘Selania’ without having to answer any unpleasant questions. And so they simply let it bob along in the harbour basin and set off on their last leg of the day, the footpath up to Fichtenstein. Once there, they stumble tiredly into Udo's ‘bar’, where he is already waiting for them with four freshly tapped beers. But to his complete surprise, they only nod wearily at him and leave the beer untouched. They shuffle up the stairs to the first floor, wish each other a good night and then disappear into their rooms. But you won't find out what awaits our well-rested adventurers the next morning until the next Arkanthia Pen and Paper blog in a fortnight' time.
