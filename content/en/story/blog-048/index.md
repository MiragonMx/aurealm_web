summary: "The potion puzzle is behind our heroes, but the mystery surrounding Grete remains unsolved. A small hut in the sulphur ponds seems to hold further answers for our heroes. Find out what they are here:"
---

After our heroes finally solved the potion puzzle, they were able to find the way to their next destination last time.

A long hike is now behind them, but late in the evening they find themselves standing in front of a small wooden hut, which appears to be their next destination. It is clear to see that the hut has been cobbled together and built in a rather unprofessional manner. The back of the hut seems to end directly at a rocky hill and merge into it. However, all these details are of secondary importance to our friends. It is much more important for them to get out of the stinking sulphur ponds and finally be able to sit down.

To their surprise, the hut is unlocked. ‘What did we make this key for?’ Kel asks the group somewhat grumpily, but only receives a helpless shrug in response. Dandelion carefully pushes open the door and enters the small hut. Dusty air greets them, but otherwise the hut appears tidy and quite neat. A small kitchenette, a makeshift bed made of dried plant debris and a small table with stools – that's all there is in terms of furnishings. And then there's a massive iron door with a lock, which gives the impression that it blocks access to an adjacent cave.

But our friends don't care about that for now. They sit down, take off their shoes and rummage for provisions. In the flickering light of Löwenzahn's oil lamp, they sit together in the small hut and consider whether they should sleep first before opening the door. After all, they know what Grete is capable of and that it's better to be well rested before facing her riddles. However, curiosity gets the better of them, and Theo begins to inspect the lock on the metal door with his ‘lock-picking’ skill. He finds a secret mechanism that is probably triggered when you poke around in the lock with a lock pick or something similar. Theo therefore cautiously digs out the key they had assembled from the pieces of metal on the floor of the tavern. He gently pushes it into the lock and it springs open with a soft click.

Before them lies a dark passageway leading deeper into the rock. Old and burnt-out torches hang from makeshift torch holders, but otherwise there is nothing to be seen. Theo turns back to his friends, grabs the oil lamp and then takes the first step. Slowly but surely, the halfling feels his way along the passageway, reassured by the quiet footsteps of his friends directly behind him. After a few metres, a larger cave opens up in front of them. They can hardly see anything, so they feel their way along the stone wall step by step. Suddenly, Theo steps on something long. Excited at the prospect of finding a torch and being able to bring a little more light into the darkness, he bends down and picks up his find – only to throw it back into the darkness in fright a moment later. ‘Fuck, that was a bone!’ Theo curses and turns to his friends with concern.

They don't know what to say either, but decide to continue anyway. It doesn't take long for them to find more bones, but they also come across a large wooden table. In addition to metal tools, empty vials and various written notes, they also find a few more torches, which they light immediately. They distribute the torches throughout the cave and also light a few fire pits scattered around the rather large cave. They walk back to the entrance of the cave, turn around and take in the sight. Countless bones, most of which are piled up in a heap, various skulls, blood-stained tools, eerie drawings and, as the highlight, a massive metal armour that probably became a metallic coffin. A skull with empty eye sockets stares eerily into the cave, making the whole scene even more sinister than it already is. With a few long strides, Löwenzahn walks over to the armour and flips down the visor. ‘Better?’ he asks his friends, who just nod silently.

Our friends no longer feel like sleeping, but their bodies are slowly demanding some rest. They extinguish the fires and leave the cave. In the small hut, they make themselves as comfortable as possible and then sink into a quick and deep sleep. Find out in two weeks on Arkanthia Pen and Paper whether they survive the night or are attacked by enchanted undead.
