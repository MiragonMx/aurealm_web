summary: "After the difficult events in Feth, our group is back on the road – not quite rested or prepared, but with lots of new stories to tell. Find out what their next plans are here:"

It took our heroes several days to get to the bottom of the mysteries surrounding Grete. In the last blog, they returned to Feth with sad news and handed over the mortal remains of their beloved to the remaining inhabitants. Exhausted, they now sit in the inn ‘The Tired Horse Legs’ and discuss their next steps.

‘Well, I think we should slowly make our way back to Chiraque and see if Nina has settled in well here,’ Aldric begins the discussion. ‘Lieutenant Kampf is probably getting nervous because we still haven't reported to him and haven't presented him with a new informant.’
‘Yeah, but I really don't feel like running into that giant guard and spending the next five years back in Nztrv,’ mutters Löwenzahn, which Theo acknowledges with an approving nod.
‘Oh, we'll just knock him out,’ Kel says confidently, agreeing with Aldric that it's time to get back to the mission. Whether this is really because he wants to complete the quest – or rather because he wants to get in touch with Nina again – is up to everyone to decide for themselves.

In the end, Kel's argument is enough to convince everyone, and their decision is made: first, they will go to Selbingen today, where they will spend the night in their new home, ‘Bleichenpreis,’ before setting off for Fichtenstein the next day. As it is already noon, our four friends waste no time, say goodbye to Feth and ride off at a gentle trot on the horses they borrowed from Bibiane.

The journey is exhausting and seems to go on forever. Our friends are slowly getting fed up with the constant back and forth – even though riding today is a comfort they have sorely missed in recent days. It is late in the evening when the lights of Selbingen appear in the darkness. The prospect of a cold beer at Andreas's ‘Gekochten Schweinekopf’ helps them get through the last few minutes. They quickly unload their belongings, take the horses to Bibiane's stable and collapse exhausted onto the bar stools.

‘You're in luck, I was just about to close up. But for local heroes like you, I'll keep my taproom open a little longer,’ she greets Andreas with a laugh and sets down four full tankards of beer. Our friends enjoy the beer – and a few more – until Andreas finally says goodbye. ‘Stay as long as you like. Close the door behind you. And you know how to use the tap.’
They laugh and agree. But they don't stay long: anyone who has ever spent a day in the saddle with a hangover knows how bad it can be.

The next morning begins later than planned. Still exhausted, Theo is the first to struggle out of bed and prepare breakfast. Löwenzahn and Aldric soon join him, but Kel stubbornly remains in bed. When sounds finally come from his room, Theo has an idea of how to punish his friend for the delay. He climbs onto the beams above the table and waits. When Kel sits down, Theo jumps down with a loud roar – but instead of landing elegantly, he rolls a critical failure on Athletics.
He loses his balance, hits his face on the edge of the table and shortly afterwards stands cursing and bleeding in front of his friends, who are almost collapsing with laughter. At least Löwenzahn gives his split upper lip some makeshift medical attention before Theo is sent to clean up. While he removes the traces of blood, the others relax and finish their surprisingly spectacular breakfast and prepare to continue their journey.

They fill their drinking tubes with cold water from Lake Selbig, pack their backpacks and leave their new home. On the way to Bibiane, they take the opportunity to do a little shopping and sell weapons in the bustling town. Kel sets off for Meckmo Hämmerich, while Theo visits Lukas Lukan Valerius' general store. Dandelion and Aldric continue on to Bibiane.

Meckmo greets Kel warmly and is interested not only in his travel stories, but also in the old iron armour from Grete's cave. After a successful sale, Kel leaves the smithy with a tidy sum of silver coins.

Theo, on the other hand, takes his time. After barely greeting Lukan, he rummages through his wares – and then suddenly starts rubbing against Lukan's leg. Whether this is due to his fall that morning or simply Theo's spontaneous, questionable nature remains unclear. What is certain, however, is that Lukan does not like this behaviour at all. He clearly points out the existence of the door to Theo, asking him to please use it. Theo does not understand why he has been thrown out, but complies and makes his way to Bibiane.

After a brief chat with her, who once again provides them with a few horses, our friends set off on the second part of their journey.
