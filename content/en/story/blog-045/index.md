summary: "No sooner has the battle against the Kraken been won than the next test awaits. This time, Aldric must face the transparent potion alone – but a blinding light leaves him seriously wounded. Shocked, the group carries him outside, but there is no time to catch their breath, for the black vial is already waiting. Find out what this entails here:"

Grete's potion puzzle has been challenging our friends for two blogs now. Although they emptied the red potion last time, it came at the cost of a difficult battle against a kraken in another dimension. However, this only got them so far in solving the puzzle. Five potions still lie ahead of them, and they can no longer count on Grete's help. But giving up is not an option for the four of them.

Since they have no idea how to proceed, they decide to simply work their way through the potions one by one, from left to right. To avoid exposing everyone to the consequences again, Aldric is chosen to face the next potion. Unsure, he trudges into the small cave while his companions wait outside. The potion on the far left is transparent. Aldric grabs the bottle, opens it and pours the contents into the cave. As a precaution, he turns away from the potion – but this only offers him limited protection. A glaring bright light spreads out, and although he reflexively closes his eyes, he is struck by a hellish pain. When the light goes out, he cautiously dares to open his eyes – and sees nothing. Grey veils dance before his inner eye, but that is all he can see. In a panic, he calls for his friends, who shortly afterwards accompany him out of the cave.

Outside, Kel and Löwenzahn realise that Aldric is indeed blinded, his eyes have failed him. Together, they carefully sit him down on a rock, give him water and try to calm him down. With moderate success – but eventually Aldric seems to come to terms with the situation. It is certainly not pleasant. Three vials have now been emptied, at least one with serious consequences, but giving up is still not an option. So they encourage each other, and Löwenzahn takes the next potion.

He steps out of the cave with a small black bottle. He tells his companions to close their eyes, cover their ears and make themselves as small as possible. Then he throws the bottle as far away as he can in a wide arc. Turn away, wait. One minute. Two minutes. Three minutes. Nothing. But then Löwenzahn sees a black cloud of steam rising menacingly. Bird-like creatures form within it, aggressively searching for a target. Suddenly, one creature fixes its gaze on him, screeches and swoops down. At the last moment, he rolls to the side and the creature shatters into a thousand pieces next to him, crumbling to dust. ‘Get into the cave immediately!’ he shouts to his friends and sprints off.

A glance at the sky shows him hundreds of such creatures circling above them like a swarm. Left and right, they hit the ground like cannonballs. A bird hits him in the calf, pain shoots through him and his leg buckles. Gasping for breath, he drags himself back into the cave, tears his trousers away from the supposed wound – but there is nothing there. No blood, no scratch. Only the pain, which slowly subsides. His companions also rush into the cave – unharmed. A brief discussion leads to the conclusion that they had better wait, because they don't need any more trouble at the moment.

After two hours, Löwenzahn ventures another look outside – and promptly several dozen birds swoop down on him. He throws himself back into the cave, impacts crashing close behind him. ‘It's not safe yet,’ he gasps, and the others have no nerve for further experiments anyway. So they decide to rest, eat and continue the next morning.
