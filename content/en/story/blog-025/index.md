The inn ‘<a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/the_wanderer">}} >Der Wanderer</a>’ has given our four friends more adventures than they expected in the last few sessions. Instead of a restful night's sleep, they first had to escape an ambush, only to take on another fight in the taproom against several litres of beer. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel Tuh Las</a> also got involved in a very personal matter. But that is all behind them now, and they finally continue on their way to <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a>.

They walk leisurely along the <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/helenau_trade_route">}} >Helenau trade route</a> to the south-west and enjoy the peaceful autumn landscape. Fertile farmland, rolling hills and expansive pastures lie golden in the sun that accompanies them on their journey. A huge lake finally appears on the horizon, and soon they catch sight of the small village of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a>, which lies quietly at a bend in the trade route. Clouds of smoke rise from the chimneys and the three illuminated towers of the cathedral stand out strikingly against the evening sky.

When they arrive in <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a>, dusk has already fallen, but many windows are illuminated. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> in particular, whose interest in religion is great, is drawn directly to the brightly lit cathedral. The other three decide to take a look at the stables at the entrance to the village before heading to the trading post.

There they meet the owner, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/lukas_lukan_valerius">}} >Lukas Lukan Valerius</a>, who offers an impressive selection of goods. However, the prices seem anything but fair to our heroes, and although <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> eventually buys a small vial of holy water, the group leaves the trading post in frustration. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/lukas_lukan_valerius">}} >Lukas</a> Lukan looks after them in disappointment, as he is usually appreciated for his fair prices and good service. But he quickly turns his attention back to his goods.

Meanwhile, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> has met the local priest Herbert, a kind but somewhat down-at-heel clergyman. Herbert enthusiastically explains his faith in the Alben family, to whom the cathedral is dedicated. He also casually mentions that he is an important source of support for the families of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a>, where the inhabitants seek shelter in times of need - especially during the recent attacks. When <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> asks what attacks he is talking about, Herbert sighs and mutters: ‘The attacks of the pale ones’. But before he can find out more, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> rush in to pick up <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a>.

In search of accommodation, their path now leads them to the shores of Lake Selbig, to the tavern ‘The Caught Eel’, a very run-down inn where they can probably find a simple bed. Two elderly men sit silently at the bar, their eyes lowered into their half-filled glasses, while the owner Fiete polishes glasses behind the counter. Visibly surprised by the visit, he offers them a room, but the state of the establishment is too poor for the group.

Their next port of call is the ‘Gekochte Schweinekopf’. The landlord Andreas runs a cleaner establishment and even offers a proper dinner as well as comfortable rooms with windows, seating and their own toilets. But apart from the loo, all the four friends are really interested in is a plate of hot food and a soft bed.

Our heroes set off early the next morning. Outside the inn, they enjoy their first view of Lake Selbig, mystically shrouded in mist. But instead of spending the morning in peace and quiet, they decide to explore <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a> further. As <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> can't let go of Herbert's strange hints, their first stop is the town hall.

Two guards in leather armour cross their spears as they arrive and ask about their request. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> briefly explains that they have heard about the attacks and would like to offer their help. This answer is enough for the guards Heino and Dittmar, who then let them into the town hall. However, we only find out what Mayor Siegfried thinks of their offer and exactly what the attacks are in the next episode of Arkanthia Pen and Paper.
