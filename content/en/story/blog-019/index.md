The last blog ended with a nasty cliffhanger when Löwenzahn tried to open a box that probably came from José. They had found it thanks to a tip from the barman Odu, where they had had a drink the night before. Unfortunately, the bar evening also led to Kel Tuh Las falling out with a sailor from Ullana Nana, who was part of the crew of the ship ‘Arsena's Tail’. In revenge, Kel sneaked into the harbour the following night and conjured up a magic bullet, which he shot directly into the bow of the merchant ship. The ‘Arsenas Schweif’ threatened to capsize as a result, but could be patched up in a makeshift manner, so that it now lies at an angle in the harbour and has to be repaired. This brought Kel satisfaction, but also a run-in from his group members.

Now they are sitting tensely in front of the crate that they found in the last session and that Löwenzahn has just opened. Inside are not only two letters, but also three throwing stars and a potion vial containing an unknown liquid. Apart from the two letters, everything goes straight into the nearest rucksack and then it's reading time. But only very briefly, because when they look at the first letter, they realise that although they can read the letters, they don't recognise the language. However, as José comes from Ullana Nana, they realise that it must be Ullana Nana. In addition to the language, they can glean further clues from the letter. It is addressed to José and signed by a certain Salima. There are also a few little hearts on the paper, which is why a second hair-splitting combination suggests that this must be a letter from José's mistress. 

With the letter in their jacket pockets, they head back to the harbour, where they immediately start looking for Eduardo, José's worried friend. They quickly find him at work and tell him of their suspicions that José could be on Midgar. Eduardo looks at them excitedly and asks what the plan is to save José. Of course, our four friends haven't thought about this yet and it's at this very moment that they realise that a boat could be very helpful in getting to an island. Eduardo has the same idea and offers to borrow the small dinghy from the ‘Selania’, the merchant ship on which he works. Positive as our friends are, they are delighted with the offer, agree immediately and arrange to meet at the quay in an hour. 

Kel, Theo, Löwenzahn and Aldric use the hour to stock up on provisions at Odu's and have another drink. Satisfied, they return to the pier and there it is, the small dinghy of the ‘Selania’. The emphasis here should really be on ‘small’, as the boat looks more like a large canoe than a ship. The thought of rowing across the open sea in this vessel doesn't excite the two of them at all, but they have no other choice. So they squeeze into the small rowing boat and slowly but surely make their way to Midgar.

As expected, the journey takes a long time, but after several hours they finally reach the small island. They dock and moor the boat with ropes to a nearby rock. Together with Eduardo, they decide to follow the coastline and circle the island bit by bit, as the rest of the small island is heavily wooded and they won't have to fight their way through the dense forest. They also hope to meet the merchant ship at some point if they simply follow the beach. They trudge on for kilometre after kilometre, but in the afternoon they finally catch sight of a stranded ship. This gives them new strength and they march quickly towards the wreck.

As they approach, the merchant ship looks pretty run-down, as if it has been lying here for a week or two. Unlike them, Eduardo pays less attention to the ship and more to footprints or other signs that could point to José. However, his search remains rather fruitless and his cries of ‘José’ go unanswered. As they are getting nowhere, Aldric decides to climb up the rock face next to the ship and jump onto the wreck from there. Everyone thinks this is a good idea and so Aldric begins the ascent. This goes relatively well, but he had underestimated how slippery the rocks directly above the water would be, with the spray repeatedly hitting the rock face. As his climbing conditions have now changed, he has to roll another test for ‘climbing’, but this time it is more difficult. This aggravation would not have been necessary, however, as Aldric rolls a crisp critical failure, which of course causes Aldric to fall. 

He lands in the water right next to the ship and is immediately caught by a strong current that wants to sweep him into the depths. Aldric remembers that the letter to José had already mentioned strong currents that would cause the ship to run aground on Midgar. Ironically, he thinks he has probably found them now and is pulled under the water again. Whether Aldric can still be rescued in time or the next blog will start with a new character introduction, you'll find out in a fortnight' time when it's time for Arkanthia Pen and Paper again.
