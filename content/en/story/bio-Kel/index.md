My name is Kel-Tuh Las,

I am 25, 195 cm tall, my chest is also 195 cm wide and I bench press more than anyone else, so this adventure belongs to me and I am the sole ruler here.

In addition to my extremely charming demeanour, which every woman immediately falls for almost "magically", I am also extremely adept at using so-called "word jokes". Differences of opinion are often won in my favour by my mere presence.

I have grown very fond of my loyal companions, who have stood by my side with help and advice in several battles and tricky situations and on whom I can always rely blindly: my best friend "Pongo", the shimmering blue dog; with the thickest antlers in the whole forest - my shimmering blue elk, "Fat Eumel" and my shimmering blue, totally non-magical battle axe Diplomacy, which is necessary for aggressive negotiations.

Naturally, I am well trained in the use of two-handed implements as thick as a branch, but I also have the delicate touch for one-handed matters.

I am also highly educated. My outstanding intellect is underlined by my specialisation in the knowledge of foreign peoples and the presentation of particularly sophisticated scripts.
