summary: "After successfully smuggling Nina into the Chiraque residence, the next mission awaits our heroes. Lieutenant Kampf sends them on a dangerous journey to a hidden guild base with a mysterious amulet. Find out what it's all about here:"
---

After our four friends completed their last quest to infiltrate a new spy into the Chiraque residence, they once again found themselves face to face with Lieutenant Kampf. Satisfied with their work, he immediately offered them another assignment: to bring a mysterious amulet to his guild's hideout. Of course, our heroes didn't need to be asked twice and immediately agreed to the deal. As an advance reward, they had been offered four different options two weeks ago – twenty shadow arrows, a pair of leather pants from the Initiative, a bomb set, or a zigzag spear – but our friends had not yet made a decision.

“I really need those pants, otherwise I'll never get a turn in battle,” Kel immediately claims one of the rewards.
“You're probably right, that would probably be a good choice,” Dandelion agreed, and Aldric and Theo nodded in agreement.
“Otherwise, I'd also be very interested in the bombs,” the halfling added, barely able to hide his greedy grin.
“Actually, I don't find the arrows or the spear very interesting either,” Dandelion replied.
“I agree,” Aldric concurs with the half-orc and then turns to Lieutenant Kampf. “We would like the bomb set and the leather pants from the initiative.”

“All right,” he replies, walking over to a cabinet on the other side of the room and rummaging around for their rewards. “Enjoy. Here's the amulet, too. I hope you'll carry out this mission as reliably as you did the search for a replacement for Emanuel.” With these words, Lieutenant Kampf turns back to his desk.

Our four friends look around uncertainly for a moment, but when Lieutenant Kampf shows no sign of continuing the conversation, they leave his office and return to their horses.
“Wow, I want to put those pants on right now,” Kel says happily, looking at the leather pants again with satisfaction.
“Yeah, but you'll have to wait a little while,” replies Theo, who would also like to test his bombs. “We're heading to Selbingen now to find this mysterious hideout.”
“But we won't make it there today, will we?” asks Löwenzahn, and his two other companions look at him in surprise.
“Then we'll just have to spend the night at the Wanderer again,” Theo grins and looks cheekily at Kel Tuh Las.
“Oh, come on, that's really not necessary,” Kel replies, but Dandelion and Aldric seem convinced by this option.
“Oh, you guys can go to hell,” Kel grumbles and walks away with a dissatisfied expression.

When his three friends catch up with him a little later on the road to Fichtenstein, Kel is still slightly annoyed, but he has regained his composure.
“Honestly, it doesn't matter that you got to know Elisabeth a little better last time. So few people stop by that she'll definitely be happy to see us anyway,” Dandelion cheers him up.
However, Kel is less concerned about what Elisabeth thinks – he just doesn't feel like seeing the landlady again. Nevertheless, he accepts his fate, and after a brief visit to Udo, our friends finally set off for Selbingen.

Our heroes now know the route between Fichtenstein and Selbingen well enough, so they ride alongside each other, feeling quite bored. Short conversations about the origin and meaning of the amulet flare up again and again, but die down just as quickly. In the early evening, they finally reach the Zum Wanderer inn. After stabling their horses outside in a small stable, they enter the inn. Elisabeth looks up from behind her counter, and her eyes widen visibly. They can't tell whether it's out of surprise, joy, or other feelings, but there's no doubt that she recognizes the group (and, to be honest, it's not really surprising after their last visit).

“Well, what can I do for you?” Elisabeth asks, addressing Kel directly. She tries to put on a mischievous smile, but it looks more like a grimace than anything erotic.
“Uh, yes, hello,” stammers Kel, before Aldric steps in again as the spokesperson.
“We'd like to stay here tonight. Four single rooms, including meals, if possible,” he explains to Elisabeth.
“Sure,” she replies. “But this time I'll take payment in advance,” she adds, giving Theo a stern look.
“That's fine,” Aldric agrees to the arrangement.

A short time later, the four of them are sitting in the taproom with greasy roast meat and tasty beer, quietly winding down the evening. This time, they actually stick to their plan and retire to their beds early, as the next day is sure to be long enough.

And so the new day begins very early. Luckily for them, Elisabeth is already up and offers them a hearty breakfast before the four of them set off back on the Helenau trade route. The entire morning is spent traveling to Selbingen until they finally reach the small town on Lake Selbig. The rocky island rises proudly from the lake – but whether our four friends actually find the hideout of Lieutenant Kampf's mysterious guild there, you'll only find out in two weeks in the next Arkanthia Pen and Paper blog.
