summary: "To solve Grete's potion puzzle, our heroes must first empty the red potion. But as soon as they pour out the red liquid, they are surrounded by a thick fog. The world tilts, and with a jolt, they lose their footing. They fall, endlessly, through a space without light. Find out what awaits them there here:"

An exhausting march from Feth to the Kresto Plateau led our four heroes to Grete's next hiding place: a small cave right next to a vast plateau. There, a riddle awaited them. Seven bottles were waiting for them, six of which had to be drunk in the correct order to get to the metallic reward at the bottom of the bottles. Our friends had already figured out the function of the seventh bottle: its contents unlock the otherwise unbreakable caps. From the riddle that Grete had carved into the stone wall, they deduced that the first bottle must be the one with red contents.

But after everything they had learned about Grete so far, she did not exactly inspire confidence. None of the four really wanted to try the potion. So, despite Grete's warning, they decided to pour the bottle out outside the cave. The red liquid splashes merrily onto the floor – and a metallic object clinks behind it. While they examine the silver thing, they don't notice that the potion is turning into a thick red mist. Seconds later, it completely surrounds them. A few breaths later, the ground beneath their feet is pulled away.

They fall through pitch-black space until they hit black rock hard. Moisture soaks through their clothes, and a salty smell of sea and fish fills their nostrils. Dazed, they scramble to their feet and try to get their bearings. They find themselves in a dark cave with a large underground lake in the middle. Small waves splash against the rocks on which they have landed. The lake seems to be completely surrounded by stone walls – but there is no exit in sight.

Suddenly, a gurgling sound comes from the depths. The water begins to move, the waves grow higher. With a deafening scream, a black kraken bursts out of the depths. The four immediately seek shelter behind the rocks and draw their weapons. With a loud bang, a tentacle strikes the wet stone, narrowly missing Aldric. He turns around, takes aim and hits one of the many eyes with a precise arrow. A bloodcurdling scream echoes through the cave as more tentacles spring up to attack.

Aldric, Kel and Löwenzahn are well prepared: bows, magic projectiles and spears keep the enemy at bay. Theo, on the other hand, has only a throwing star and a few old daggers – his previous attempts at ranged combat have been disastrous and often more dangerous for his comrades than for the enemy. But he has no choice. So he hurls everything he can find at the monster. Although the damage he causes is minimal, this time luck is on his side: one critical hit after another. First, he uses a well-aimed throwing star to collapse the rock above the kraken's head, causing sharp stones to injure the monster's face. Then he hits sensitive tendons on several tentacles, which sink back into the water, limp and useless.

While Theo robs the kraken of its strength piece by piece, his companions relentlessly pursue it. Finally, the combined attacks take effect. Despite a few hits landed by the kraken, the four manage to defeat the monster. With one last struggle, it sinks motionless back into the dark depths.

Exhausted and with throbbing heads, the heroes wake up a little later in the clearing on the Kresto Plateau. The red mist has disappeared, and the empty bottle lies innocently in their midst. More exciting, however, is the piece of silver metal they have gained in the process. Upon examination, it becomes clear that it is only part of a larger object that must first be assembled. To find the remaining parts, they must also open the other potions – but they can no longer count on Grete's help. They have literally thrown the puzzle away.
