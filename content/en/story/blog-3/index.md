summary: "Our group of Kel Tuh Las, Löwenzahn, Theo and Aldric arrive at the small camp in the Telzer swamp, which they discovered last time. Here they meet Feandal the fisherman, who gives them a brief summary of which country and world they live in. After a night in Feandal's camp, he has another mission for our group. You can find out what it is and how the four of them go about it here:"

After Kel Tuh Las, Löwenzahn, Theo and Aldric successfully freed themselves from slavery in the last session, our four escapees now drag themselves to a small camp in the Telzer Moor. As they approach, they notice some nets hanging in the small streams and ponds nearby, presumably to catch fish. In the camp itself, they can see a scrawny but tall, fair-haired man who is in the process of hanging up some of the fish he has caught on drying racks. His eyes fall on the new arrivals and, startled, he stumbles back a few meters. Despite the disastrously low social skills of our group, they quickly manage to convince the fisherman that they are not dangerous, and with a friendly "Well then, have a seat, I've just finished dinner", he invites the four of them to stay. Thankful and looking forward to a warm meal, our former slaves immediately sit down around the small campfire flickering in the middle of the camp. The fisherman, who introduces himself as Feandal, hands everyone a small jug of fresh rainwater and some dried fish. Quite disappointed, the four of them start chewing on the dry sole of the shoe, while Aldric wonders whether he would have been better off making use of his skills as a field cook. After all, Feandal is a good source of information. He tells our group that they are on the continent of Aurealm. This consists of two large land masses that are connected by a small land bridge in the middle. They themselves inhabit the right half of the continent and live in the kingdom of Zazyrus. This is ruled by a Zyre, who passes on his power to his first-born son shortly before his death. In addition to Zazyrus, there is also the land of Thauros and Rhatcyl on the right side of Aurealm. While Thauros is the protectorate of Zazyrus, Rhatcyl is ruled by ice and cold instead of a monarch. In addition, the Ulana Nana Islands lie off the coast of Zazyrus, in the delta of the Luvua, a large river that runs through the right half of Aurealm. The other, left side of Aurealm is dominated by the Balrumans, with whom Zazyrus has been at war for decades, if not centuries. However, the group is currently far away from the front in the North Marsh, the north-eastern part of Zazyrus. Otherwise, magic is strictly forbidden in Zazyrus, as it is in Thauros. Rumor has it that this is the reason for the war against Balrum, as magic is to be encouraged and taught in Balrum. After this extensive storytelling session, not only are our four adventurers tired, but so is Feandal. Unfortunately, the latter cannot provide comfortable sleeping accommodation, so Kel Tuh Las, Theo, Aldric and Löwenzahn spend the night under makeshift covers.

The next morning is cold and thick clouds of mist surround the camp. The four of us struggle to get out of the clammy blankets under which they have spent the night. Over a hearty breakfast of dried fish, Feandal mentions the appearance of an unusually large anaconda, which has made life in the moor more dangerous. As they are well aware of such a creature, Theo tells them about the reptile fight the group had witnessed the day before. Feandal is not particularly pleased that a giant crocodile is now moving through the rivers alongside a giant anaconda, so he asks the group to tackle the problem. Theo, Kel Tuh Las, Aldric and Löwenzahn look at each other in amazement and wonder which weapons they should use to kill a 7-meter-long crocodile or an even longer anaconda. Löwenzahn, who has been lusting after Feandal's wooden spears for hunting fish since their arrival, sees his chance and explains that weapons are needed for such a task. Spears, of course, are particularly suitable for such a task. Aldric, on the other hand, whose weapon of choice is a crossbow, is not so lucky and has to make do without a weapon for the time being. Theo misuses a normal kitchen knife as a dagger for the time being, and Kel Tuh Las is equipped with his magical axe, which is illegal but powerful. However, before anyone in the group makes a move, a reward must of course be negotiated. Unfortunately, Feandal is not particularly interested, but offers the group kilos of their beloved dried fish. He also promises to go through his belongings again while they are on the road. Dissatisfied with the meagre offer, Löwenzahn at least insists on being allowed to keep his spear beyond the end of the quest and to receive two more spears as replacements. During their negotiations, a new arrival arrives at the camp. It is Wilhelm, a farmer from the surrounding area, who often carries out small barter deals with Feandal and had a stall at Chiraque's festival yesterday. In order not to keep Wilhelm waiting too long, Feandal finally gives in to Löwenzahn's demands and the group sets off across the swamp.

As many disadvantages as one might think of for a reptile several meters tall, its size does help in the search. Back at the spot where the four of them observed the fight between the crocodile and the anaconda, they immediately notice a larger, scale-covered mountain on the other side of the lake. With summoned war axe and spears at the ready, Kel Tuh Las and Löwenzahn charge towards the tired-looking reptile. Theo and Aldric, on the other hand, try to pick up some stones so that they at least have something resembling a weapon in their hands. The crocodile seems exhausted and lethargic and does not attack the group directly, which Aldric uses to optimize his fighting position and climb a nearby tree. A stone thrown from the tree finally hits the crocodile on its massive snout. However, this is now too much of a good thing for the crocodile too, and it begins to run towards Kel Tuh Las and Löwenzahn. After two more barrages of stones from Theo and Aldric have hit the crocodile, causing almost no damage, it finally comes within range of Löwenzahn's spears. These don't seem to be of the highest quality either and may be just enough to kill small fish, but they also do little damage to large crocodiles. Fortunately, the group still has a highly illegal mage. Due to a very clumsy character creation, this mage rarely gets a turn, but he does give the crocodile a good beating with his war axe. A hail of stones and wooden spears later, Kel sets off for the finale. As with Emanuel, his axe is once again aimed at the head, but this time he beheads the crocodile cleanly instead of splitting its skull open. In the boundless loot mania, the contents of the animal's stomach are of course also examined. Here the group finds the reason for the crocodile's sluggishness with large quantities of anaconda meat. With several square meters of crocodile skin, pockets full of crocodile meat and a crocodile head in their arms, the group walks back to Feandal's camp, satisfied. You can read what he has to say about this impressive battle trophy next time.
