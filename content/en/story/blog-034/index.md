summary: "Now that Selbingen has been freed from its threat, it's time for some time off. So Aldric and Theo set off for the legendary mead factory ‘Odin's Waters’ - in search of good mead and a tempting deal. Meanwhile, Löwenzahn roams the countryside in search of Bibiane and her horses... And Kel? He's on a completely different ‘quest’:"

In an exuberant and celebratory speech in the last blog, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel Tuh Las</a> declared to the entire village of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a> that the threat posed by the Pale Ones had been eradicated and that the village could now sleep in peace again. This speech apparently sparkled with so much sex appeal that <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> was immediately approached by two young women. But before he could go on a date, some work had to be done first. With <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a>'s help, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> sold some weapons to Meckmo and then headed off on a date. The date was a success, but what did <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> do in the meantime?

Shortly after <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> returned to their beach hut ‘<a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/beach_cabin_bleichenpreis">}} >Bleichenpreis</a>’ from their trading meeting with <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/lukas_lukan_valerius">}} >Lukas Lukan Valerius</a>, they heard from <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> that <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> was on his way and that he was about to go to <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/bibiane">}} >Bibiane</a>'s stable to see if she had returned. However, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> don't find this so exciting, and because they don't want to crash <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a>'s date, they decide to pursue a different destination: the small mead factory, which is said to be about an hour from the gates of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a>. So the three of them set off and say goodbye to each other after a few metres.

<a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> is drawn to <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/bibiane">}} >Bibiane</a>'s burnt-down stable, where he hopes to meet the horse breeder again. But to his dissatisfaction, he is disappointed. The former stables lie cold and charred at his feet, and there is not a single thing resembling a horse to be seen. He makes a quick enquiry at the nearby residential buildings, but again he finds nothing of use, so he decides to take the initiative himself. He thinks about what he would have done in <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/bibiane">}} >Bibiane</a>'s place and comes to the conclusion that <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/bibiane">}} >Bibiane</a> and her horses would probably look for new accommodation first. He therefore decides to take a short walk into the Astral, the small low mountain range north of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a>, and look out for the horses and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/bibiane">}} >Bibiane</a> from there.

<a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> are also heading in this direction, but walk a kilometre or two east of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> towards the grove where ‘Odin's Waters’, the small mead production facility, is said to be. After a good hour, a fairly large house comes into their field of vision and they knock carefully on the large wooden door. ‘What do you want again, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aki</a>?’ is the friendly greeting they hear from inside. Annoyed, the door is pulled open and a tall man stands in front of them. He looks at them, startled, and immediately apologises for his unfriendliness. He introduces himself as Odin, the owner of the brewery. They talk about his business and mead for a few minutes before <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> tells him about the wagon delivery he has ordered for Yuri. Odin immediately knows what it's all about and shows them the large wagon load. Odin tells them that he normally offers his customers a small tour of the brewery when they place such large orders and asks whether they might be interested. Naturally, he opens the door to our two schnapps drinkers and they are immediately on board.

While they are walking around among the wooden barrels, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> can't stand it any longer and asks Odin who this <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aki</a> is that he was grumbling about earlier. Odin explains that this is his annoying little brother, who lives here in the forest as a woodcutter. He annoys him all the time and always wants something from him, even though he decided to leave the company and do his own thing in the forest. And now he wants support but won't do anything in return. Odin seems to have an idea and offers the two of them a deal. They'll give his brother a good wanking in return for a pallet of mead on the house. Of course, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> don't have to think about it any further, but naturally accept the deal immediately.

But before the two of them head off into the woods to annoy poor <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aki</a>, we take another look at <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a>'s second date. After freshening up between the two dates, he meets the second young lady at the <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/selbingen">}} >Selbingen</a> pier. To avoid being discovered by his morning date, he quickly invites her to her beach house ‘<a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/beach_cabin_bleichenpreis">}} >Bleichenpreis</a>’. This is probably where the young woman wanted to go anyway, as they have not yet taken a full step into the hut when she jumps on <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a>'s back. She savagely kisses his head and neck, leaving little doubt as to her intentions. Heroic as <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> is, he selflessly offers her his help and also successfully completes this quest. You will find out in a fortnight' time in the next Arkanthia Pen and Paper blog whether he has the chance of a repeat performance the next morning and in what form <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> will take on the woodcutter <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aki</a>.
