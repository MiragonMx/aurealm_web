A panic attack by <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> that developed into a permanent phobia of water, the discovery of a very rare stone, a fight with the Ullanic sailor Eduardo and the journey to the previously unknown island of Logar. This all happened in the last Arkanthia Pen and Paper blog. Today we continue our exploration of the island of Logar, with <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> concentrating on getting his fear of the water under control. To do this, he has made himself comfortable on the beach with a view inland. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel Tuh Las</a> are not particularly interested in spending time with <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a>, however, preferring instead to explore the island. So they leave most of their things with <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a> and walk along the beach.

After half an hour's walk, however, they realise that the island is not much different from <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/helenau_trade_route">}} >Midgar</a>. But just before they want to turn around, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> discovers something pink lying on the beach. A short sprint later, he is standing in front of a large jellyfish, its long nettles splaying out in all directions. Interested, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> pokes the jellyfish with his shoe, but as expected, the jellyfish only reacts by wobbling its body and does not suddenly start a conversation with <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a>. Unfortunately, his knowledge of nature doesn't help him either, which is why <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> sees only one way to find out more about the creature. He puts on his leather gloves, tears off a nettle and slaps it on <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a>'s arm. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> looks at <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> in shock, complains what this is all about and then realises the pain. He hastily removes the nettle from his arm and tries to rinse it off in the sea water, but the train has left the station. His skin burns like fire and, furious, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> gets a barrage of swear words. But then <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> suddenly starts to laugh. And then he laughs even louder. And then he runs in circles. He throws his arms up. And then he runs away.

<a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> look at each other with amusement and wonder why the second member of the group has to go crazy after <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a>. Of course, it doesn't occur to them that the whole thing could have been <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a>'s fault. But before <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> disappears completely into the distance, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> grabs some of the nettles and then they decide to collect <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> again. Meanwhile, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> is happy about every stone, every leaf and every beautiful wave. But then he takes an interest in the interior and runs through dense forest before coming across a small lake. This is where <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel Tuh Las</a> finally catch up with him. The two try to talk some sense into him and persuade him to return to their boat. But <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> has other plans and leaves again, babbling wildly, to set off on new adventures. And so <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> trot after <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a>, who has gone mad, for just under an hour. In the process, they explore Logar and realise that <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/helenau_trade_route">}} >Midgar</a>'s sister island is a good deal bigger and even has some impressive little mountains. However, it has to be said that the effect of the jellyfish nettle impresses them even more.

After what feels like an eternity, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> calms down a little and although he is still hyper, it is still a nice change for his two companions not to have to stop at every little tree because <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> wants to marvel at it. With some good coaxing and by drawing <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a>'s attention purely by chance to things that are back in the direction of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a>, they slowly but surely move back towards him. 

After another half hour, they are back in front of the still pale <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a>, who is looking at them with real pity. Now that the three of them have got a good enough impression of Logar and are somewhat disillusioned that there are no wild adventures to be had here, they are at least somewhat motivated to paddle back to <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a>. <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/aldric_von_praven">}} >Aldric</a>, on the other hand, cannot share this motivation. He absent-mindedly sits down in the small boat again, but this time not without first making it clear that they really have to go to the harbour of <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a> and not decide on a new excursion destination. This is actually a very good idea, as <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/kel_tuh_las">}} >Kel</a>, <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/theobald_bonter">}} >Theo</a> and <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/löwenzahn">}} >Löwenzahn</a> are also looking forward to <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/udo">}} >Udo</a>'s soft beds. 

They finally reach the harbour late in the evening. Exhausted from the journey, they clamber out of the boat. As Eduardo is no longer around, they don't really know how to hand over the dinghy to the crew of the ‘Selania’ without having to answer any unpleasant questions. And so they simply let it bob along in the harbour basin and set off on their last leg of the day, the footpath up to <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/places/fichtenstein">}} >Fichtenstein</a>. Once there, they stumble tiredly into <a class="glossary-link" href={{<ref "glossary/people/udo">}} >Udo</a>'s ‘bar’, where he is already waiting for them with four freshly tapped beers. But to his complete surprise, they only nod wearily at him and leave the beer untouched. They shuffle up the stairs to the first floor, wish each other a good night and then disappear into their rooms. But you won't find out what awaits our well-rested adventurers the next morning until the next Arkanthia Pen and Paper blog in a fortnight' time.
