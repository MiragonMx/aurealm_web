In the world of Arkanthia, our journey begins in the land of Zazyrus, in a slave mine called "Gugneaug", where countless slaves mine the valuable rock "Nztrv". The ruler of the mine is Monsieur Chiraque, who lives in the residence of the same name directly behind the mine site.

The adventure begins on a foggy morning, the first rays of sunshine break through the clearing cloud cover and chaos reigns on the forecourt of the "Chiraque Residence". Carts, wagons and horses are jumbled together while servants desperately try to distribute them to their designated places. More carts struggle along the cobbled path that connects the residence with the Helenau trade route through the Telzer Moor. Extensive gardens stretch out in front of the residence, while the dug-up mine site lies behind it. Everywhere, half-collapsed tunnels lead into the ground from which countless cart tracks make their way to the railway station to the south. Thick clouds of smoke on the horizon signal the approaching arrival of the goods train carrying the Nztrv mined here to the frontline. Completely exhausted and dirty from the hard labour underground, four slaves heave the last remnants of the black but greenish shimmering stone onto the waiting wagons. A small, particularly shiny shard secretly finds its way into Kel Tuh Las' pocket. The stone will make a great necklace one day. Before Kel can even finish this thought, a loud shout rings out across the grounds. "Body control!" shouts the guard placed on the watchtower, grinning broadly. Out of nowhere, five guards stand behind the small group and twist their arms behind their backs. The guard strolls slowly from the watchtower towards the four slaves, stands in front of Kel Tuh Las and asks mockingly: "Surely we won't find anything on you?"

Before Kel Tuh Las can answer this question, however, our four slaves introduce themselves. Today we start with the halfling Theobald Bonter.
