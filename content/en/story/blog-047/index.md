summary: "White mist, a glowing blade and a ghostly warrior await our heroes this time. But the ensuing battle will not be in vain, as the warrior has valuable information for our friends. Find out what that is here:"

Finally, in the last blog, our heroes were able to empty the seven potion bottles. They were also able to quickly assemble a key from the silver metal pieces hidden at the bottom of the bottles. However, they don't really know yet which lock it can open. To give their brain cells new energy for thinking, the four decided to take a short break for food last time. To this end, Löwenzahn and Aldric set off to gather wood. However, as the potions they had drunk soon took their toll, they found themselves peeing by a small stream after a few minutes. But the idyll was quickly destroyed when a silvery, shimmering ghost warrior rose from their former bladder contents.

The knight is still striding towards them with long steps, a white-hot blade in his hand. Aldric and Löwenzahn quickly rush back a few metres, drawing their weapons. The ghost knight launches his first attack with a swift blow, but Löwenzahn skilfully dodges it. While Aldric continues to drop back so he can use his bow in peace, Löwenzahn stabs with his spear. He hits the knight, but although his spear clearly penetrates the ghost's flank, Löwenzahn feels no resistance. The knight takes advantage of his brief pause and swings his blade at Löwenzahn's torso. A searing pain shoots through Dandelion, and he feels an injury in his body, although he cannot find any open wounds on himself. In the meantime, Aldric has drawn his bow and now fires the first arrow at the ghost knight. The arrow flies precisely into the ghost's skull and somehow remains stuck there. More arrows follow in quick succession until several are stuck criss-cross in the knight's head. Meanwhile, Löwenzahn does everything he can to keep the ghost knight away from his archer. After another volley of Aldric's arrows, the knight collapses and supports himself with both hands on his knees. ‘Enough,’ a throaty voice echoes through the forest. ‘You have defeated me, now you shall receive your reward.’

As quickly as the knight appeared, he vanishes again. While Aldric's arrows are still clattering to the ground, the same throaty voice begins to give them precise directions through the Kresto Plateau to the sulphur ponds. After the voice falls silent, a few seconds pass before the identical directions are heard again. The voice repeats the directions over and over again, so that Aldric and Löwenzahn are soon sure that they have memorised the way. They set off back to their camp, but the voice simply does not get any quieter.

Kel and Theo wait wide-eyed for their two friends in their rudimentary camp. ‘How did you manage that?’ Theo blurts out, and so Aldric and Löwenzahn briefly recount their bizarre encounter. Already somewhat impressed, Kel and Theo pay their respects to the two and then cautiously ask about the firewood that the two were supposed to fetch, but obviously don't have with them. Laughing, Löwenzahn and Aldric turn around and quickly gather some wood before finally taking their well-deserved break.

After several hours of descent, the terrain flattens out again and the vegetation becomes noticeably sparser. Another hour later, our four heroes find themselves in the middle of the sulphur ponds. Thousands of rotting pools, barren trees and a terrible smell of sulphur make their stay here quite unpleasant, but they stubbornly continue to follow the ghost knight's directions. After a long day, they finally reach a tiny wooden hut located directly on a somewhat stony slope. This is where the directions end – which is just as well, because our heroes would not have had the strength to go much further today anyway. But you'll have to wait until the next Arkanthia Pen and Paper to find out what awaits them in the hut.
