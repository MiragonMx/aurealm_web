I'm Theobald Bonter, but everyone actually calls me Theo. I got my surname from my humble farming parents, Bill and Bo, with whom I grew up on the farm in the Bingst farmlands with my brother. There I quickly outgrew my family, because at 98 cm I am already one of the taller halflings. When I grew up a few years ago, I left this home behind me because I realised that there was more to my life than cabbages and haylofts. Since then, I've managed to get by, using my physical abilities to my advantage here and there and honing my skills in the flexible acquisition of objects of interest and information. Of course, I also regularly do the latter with my means of defence of choice: my daggers. I have learnt to use them in dicey situations, especially out of surprise, and otherwise try to stay out of conflicts - literally, relying (more or less justifiably) on my throwing skills with daggers, stars or slingshots. Naturally, I'm not quite as good at stabbing, but after a rather unpleasant period of absolute slavery in the Nztrv mine 'Gugneaug', I've now found my group of fiends. They can handle it better and some of them "cough" Kel-Tu Las "cough" know how to emphasise their strength, so I really enjoy travelling with them despite sporadic outbreaks of absurd violence and have already seen and achieved a lot in this time together - in the meantime it has even taken us past my family, whether that was really a good thing I still have to think about for myself... But I'm sure there's still a lot to come and I definitely wouldn't swap it for the cabbages!
